# Personality_prediction
A machine learning project that uses classification algorithms to divides people into personality types based on the Big Five Personality traits.

Psychology has always been my area of interest as well as machine learning. I am planning on starting this project where I will be developing a system for personality prediction using the Big Five Personality traits(OCEAN):
1. Extraversion
2. Openness to experiences
3. Agreeableness
4. Neuroticism
5. Conscientiousness

The dataset was collected from an interactive online personality test. The metrics are: 1-Strongly Disagree, 2-Disagree, 3-Neutral, 4-Agree, 5-Strongly Agree
I'll be using unsupervised KMeans Algorithm for clustering the participants into the ideal number of personality types.
