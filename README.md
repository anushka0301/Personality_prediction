# Personality_prediction
A machine learning project that uses classification algorithms to divides people into personality types based on the Big Five Personality traits.

Psychology has always been my area of interest as well as machine learning. I am planning on starting this project where I will be developing a system for personality prediction using the Big Five Personality traits:
1. Extraversion
2. Openness
3. Agreeableness
4. Neuroticism
5. Conscientiousness

I would be using the Random Forest classification algorithm. The dataset is from kaggle.
